        <h3>Birth of the School</h3>
        <p>
          Shalom International School was founded in the year 1997 by
          <strong>Sir (Hon.) Chidi Amadi and Dr. Lady Vidal Amadi</strong>, who
          shared a passion for giving young learners a strong moral and academic
          foundation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Starting with just <strong>18 pupils, 4 dedicated teachers, and 4 classrooms</strong>,
          the school was created to provide a nurturing environment where children
          could grow intellectually, emotionally, and socially.
        </p>
        <p>
          What began as a simple dream quickly became a mission:
          <em>to raise a new generation of confident, disciplined, and academically sound children.</em>

        <h3>The Formative Years</h3>
        <p>
          In the early years, Shalom International School focused heavily on strong
          teaching standards and personalized attention.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Academic excellence</li>
          <li>Character and moral development</li>
          <li>Clean, safe, and supportive classrooms</li>
          <li>Strong relationships between teachers, pupils, and parents</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These formative years shaped the identity of the school and laid the

        <h3>Becoming Strong and Stable</h3>
        <p>
          As the school's reputation grew, so did its population. The addition of
          new classrooms, improved learning materials, and more qualified staff
          helped the school transition into one of the most respected schools in
          Port Harcourt.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Expansion from a handful of learners to hundreds of pupils</li>
          <li>Recruitment of trained, passionate educators</li>
          <li>Structured academic programmes aligned with global standards</li>
          <li>Improved administrative and support systems</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This period marked Shalom as a reliable, stable, and well-organized
          institution.
